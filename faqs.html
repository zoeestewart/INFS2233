					<h2> Delivery </h2>
						
					<h3>How do you ship the shoes?</h3>
					<p class="para"> We courier your completed shoes with FedEx to US addresses, and DHL Express to the rest of the world. For PO Box addresses, we use EMS.

Please don't forget that someone will need to sign for your exciting delivery, so we advise using an office address.
</br>
We’ll cover the cost of shipping to Australia, excluding those as shown on our Shipping Page and some remote addresses. For some countries, import duties are excluded from the prices you see at the checkout, and you may be required to pay import duties upon receipt of your order or at a later date, depending on the requisites of your customs authority. For more information, visit our Shipping Page. </p>
			
 					<h3>Do you deliver anywhere in the world?</h3>
					<p class="para">Absolutely! We courier your completed shoes with FedEx to US addresses, and DHL Express to the rest of the world. For PO Box addresses, we use EMS. </p>
					
					<h3>Do you offer an express delivery option?</h3>
					<p class="para">Our shoes currently take approximately 4-5 weeks to hand make and package, and an additional 2-4 days to deliver to your door. However, if you have a special event or occasion coming up that you need your shoes for, please contact us to let us know when you place your order so that we know when this is. </p>
					
					<h3>Can you ship to a PO Box?</h3>
					<p class="para">We normally send your handmade shoes directly to you using FedEx (USA) and DHL (rest of world) however if you prefer to use a PO Box for delivery we will send your exciting package via EMS, which uses your local mail service and which may take a few more days than a courier usually would.</p>
					
					<h3>How long will my shoes take?</h3>
					<p class="para">Our shoes currently take approximately 4-5 weeks to hand craft and carefully package, and an additional 2-4 days to deliver to your door. If you live in a rural area, please remember it can take the courier a bit longer to reach you. If you're concerned about your shoes reaching you in time, just contact us and we'll look into this for you.</p>
					
					<h3>How do I track my shoes?</h3>
					<p class="para">If you'd like the tracking number for your shoes, please just email us at info@customTreds.com.au and we'll send it to you right away!  </p>
					
					<h3> I've placed my order. How do I know when my shoes will be ready?</h3>
					<p class="para">You can check your Order Confirmation Email for the estimated date of delivery of your shoes, however please note this is just an estimation. They could arrive a little later or, even better, a little earlier!</p>

					<h2> Sizing </h2>
						
					<h3> What sizes do you offer?</h3>
					<p class="para"> We make our shoes in European sizes, including half sizes. If you don't know your European size, simply check ... </p>
			
 					<h3>How do I know which size to select or that you'll get the size right?</h3>
					<p class="para">After lots of experimentation, we've found that making your shoes in your normal size, 
					or the size you wear most often, is the best way for us to get sizing right for you. 
					Different shoe brands use different sizing systems, but we've had a really high success rate with this method. 
					If you're not sure which size to select during checkout, just add some information in the comments box about your feet 
					and size and we'll get in touch to confirm the best size to try.</p>
					
					<h3> Wouldn't it be better if I sent you measurements or a drawing of my feet?</h3>
					<p class="para">Measuring and drawing around feet accurately is really difficult to do without proper training. Everyone has different methods to measure and draw around their feet and so our technicians find these quite difficult to work with. A half size is equivalent to 3 millimetres so, if a measurement or drawing is even a little inaccurate, the size of the shoes will be incorrect. </p>
					
					<h3> I have very wide feet. Can you make shoes for me?</h3>
					<p class="para">We can make our shoes wider for you, that's not a problem. When you place your order and reach our checkout page you'll have the opportunity to select your fitting between Standard, Wide or Extra Wide. You can also add any more useful information about your feet in the Sizing Comments box.</p>
					
					<h3>I have very narrow feet. Can you make shoes for me?</h3>
					<p class="para">We can make our shoes narrower for you, that's not a problem. When you place your order and reach our checkout page you'll have the opportunity to select your fitting, Narrow or Extra Narrow. You can also add any more useful information about your feet in the Sizing Comments box.</p>

					<h2> Returns & Remakes </h2>
						
					<h3> What if my shoes are not right? </h3>
					<p class="para"> We want you to love your shoes so we'll be just as upset as you if they're not right!
					</br>
					If you have problems with the fit, then take a look at our Comfort & Shoe Tips section above for some great ideas on improving this.
					</br>
					If these tips don't help and the shoes simply don't fit, or if you're not happy with your shoes for any reason, then we'll happily remake them for you free of charge, or provide a full refund. </p>
			
 					<h3>How do I return my shoes?</h3>
					<p class="para">If you need to return your shoes then it's really simple. Just email info@customTreds.com.au let us know you'd like to return them and why. We'll then send you details on how to return them to us and confirm the next steps to remake or refund your shoes.</p>
					
					<h3>  What if I need to remake my shoes a second time?</h3>
					<p class="para">We'd love to help you with this remake personally! Please contact us and we'll be in touch shortly to discuss your remake. 
				</p>
					
					<h3>  Can I have a refund?</h3>
					<p class="para">We'll be really sad if your shoes aren't perfect for you, but we're happy to refund you in full within 365 days of your purchase upon receipt of your returned shoes.</p>
